## 📅 Day 19 | Amazon CloudFront — Content Delivery Network (CDN) in AWS 🌍⚡

Today, I learned about **Amazon CloudFront**, which is a **fast, secure, and scalable Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service provided by AWS.

CloudFront delivers **web content, images, videos, APIs, and static files** to users from **edge locations** (servers closest to users), reducing latency and improving performance.

CloudFront helps in building **highly available, low-latency, and secure applications**, making it an essential service in **DevOps and cloud-native architectures**.

# Amazon CloudFront in AWS DevOps – Step-by-Step Guide
   
## 1. What is Amazon CloudFront? 

Amazon CloudFront is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service provided by AWS.

It delivers content like:
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript
- Images
- Videos 
- APIs

from **edge locations** (servers near users) to provide **low latency and high speed**. 

**Main Goal:**
- Faster website performance
- Reduced load on backend servers 
- Secure and scalable content delivery 

--- 
 
## 2. Why CloudFront is Important in DevOps?

In DevOps, applications are deployed frequently and accessed globally.

CloudFront helps by:
- Caching content
- Improving performance
- Reducing server load
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
- Providing security (HTTPS, WAF)

---

## 3. How CloudFront Works (Architecture Flow)

### Request Flow:

1. User requests `www.example.com`
2. Request goes to the nearest **CloudFront Edge Location**
3. CloudFront checks cache:
   - If content exists → serve immediately
   - If not → request goes to **Origin**
4. Origin sends data to CloudFront
5. CloudFront caches the data and delivers it to the user
6. Next users get cached content faster

---

## 4. What is an Origin?

**Origin** is the source of original content.

Common origins:
- Amazon S3 
- EC2 Instance
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- API Gateway

---

## 5. Key Components of CloudFront

| Component | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Distribution | CloudFront configuration |
| Origin | Source of content |
| Edge Location | CDN server near users |
| Cache Behavior | Rules for caching |
| TTL | Cache duration |
| Invalidation | Clear cached content |

---

## 6. Step-by-Step: Using CloudFront with S3

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
- Create bucket (example: `my-static-site`)
- Upload files: `index.html`, `style.css`
- Enable **Static Website Hosting**
- Configure permissions or OAC

---

### Step 2: Create CloudFront Distribution
1. Go to CloudFront
2. Click **Create Distribution**
3. Select S3 bucket as Origin
4. Enable **Origin Access Control (OAC)**
5. Set Default Root Object: `index.html`
6. Redirect HTTP → HTTPS
7. Create distribution

---

### Step 3: Access Website
CloudFront provides a domain like:



Your website is now faster and globally accessible.

---

## 7. Cache Behavior Explained

CloudFront caches content based on:
- URL path
- Headers
- Cookies
- Query strings

Example:
- `/static/*` → Cached
- `/api/*` → Not cached

---

## 8. Cache Invalidation

When content changes, CloudFront may still serve old cached files.

### To invalidate cache:
1. Open CloudFront Distribution
2. Go to Invalidations
3. Add paths:


---

## 9. CloudFront with EC2 / ALB

### Flow:
User → CloudFront → ALB → EC2

Use cases:
- Dynamic web applications
- APIs
- Microservices

Benefits:
- Reduced latency
- Reduced backend load
- Better security

---

## 10. Security Features in CloudFront

| Feature | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| HTTPS | Secure data transfer |
| AWS WAF | Protect from attacks |
| Signed URLs | Restrict access |
| Geo Restriction | Country-based access |
| OAC | Secure S3 access |

---

## 11. CloudFront in CI/CD (DevOps Use Case)

### Typical Flow:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. CI/CD pipeline builds project
3. Files uploaded to S3
4. CloudFront cache invalidation triggered
5. Users see updated content instantly

---

## 12. Common Interview Questions

### What is CloudFront?
A CDN service that delivers content with low latency using edge locations.

### What is an Edge Location?
A server that caches and delivers content closer to users.

### Difference between S3 and CloudFront?
- S3 stores data
- CloudFront delivers data faster using caching

### Why use CloudFront in DevOps?
For speed, scalability, security, and CI/CD integration.

---

## 13. Real-Time Use Cases

- Static websites (React, Angular)
- Video streaming
- API acceleration
- E-commerce websites
- Software downloads

---

## 14. Summary

Amazon CloudFront is a powerful CDN service that:
- Improves performance
- Enhances security
- Reduces backend load
- Fits perfectly into DevOps pipelines
