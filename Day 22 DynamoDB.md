 # 📅 Day 22 | AWS DynamoDB — Serverless NoSQL Database in AWS ⚡☁️

Today, I learned about **AWS DynamoDB**, a fully managed, serverless, NoSQL database service designed to provide fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It’s a favorite for DevOps and Cloud Engineers because it removes the administrative burden of operating and scaling distributed databases.

# ⚡ AWS DynamoDB – DevOps Explanation 

## What is AWS DynamoDB?

**AWS DynamoDB** is a **Serverless NoSQL Database** that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic.

Unlike relational databases (RDS), DynamoDB is **non-relational**, meaning it doesn't use fixed schemas or complex joins. AWS handles the:

* Hardware provisioning
* Setup and configuration  
* Replication and software patching
* Cluster scaling 
 
---

## Why DevOps Engineers Use DynamoDB 

DynamoDB is the go-to choice when: 
  
* You need **extreme scale** (millions of requests per second)
* You require **consistent low latency** (single-digit milliseconds)
* You want a **serverless architecture** (no instances to manage)
* You need **global availability** (Global Tables)

---

## Core Concepts (The Fundamentals)

* **Tables:** Similar to a table in SQL, but with no fixed schema.
* **Items:** Similar to a "row." Each item is a collection of attributes.
* **Attributes:** Similar to a "column." Can be strings, numbers, binaries, or even JSON (Maps/Lists).
* **Primary Key:** Must be defined at creation. It consists of:
    * **Partition Key (PK):** Used for internal data distribution.
    * **Sort Key (SK):** (Optional) Used to sort data within a partition.

---

## DynamoDB Features & Architecture

* **High Availability:** Data is automatically replicated across three Availability Zones (AZs) within a region.
* **Read Consistency:** * **Eventually Consistent** (Default) – Best performance, lowest cost.
    * **Strongly Consistent** – Returns the most up-to-date data.
* **DynamoDB Streams:** Captures item-level changes (Insert/Update/Delete) and triggers **AWS Lambda**—perfect for event-driven apps.
* **TTL (Time to Live):** Automatically deletes expired items to reduce storage costs.

---

## Capacity Modes (How you pay)

1. **On-Demand:** You pay per request. Best for unpredictable workloads or new apps.
2. **Provisioned:** You specify **RCU (Read Capacity Units)** and **WCU (Write Capacity Units)**. Best for predictable traffic and cost control (supports Auto Scaling).

---

## Indexing for Performance

Since you can only query by Primary Key, you use Indexes to query other attributes:

* **Local Secondary Index (LSI):** Same Partition Key, different Sort Key. (Must be created with the table).
* **Global Secondary Index (GSI):** Different Partition Key AND different Sort Key. (Can be created anytime).

---

## Security in DynamoDB

* **IAM:** Control who can read/write to specific tables.
* **Encryption at Rest:** All data is encrypted by default using AWS KMS.
* **VPC Endpoints:** Keep traffic within the AWS network (Gateway Endpoint).
* **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Using IAM policies to restrict access to specific items or attributes.

---

## Common Use Cases

* **Serverless Apps:** Paired with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
* **Session Management:** Storing user sessions for web applications.
* **Gaming:** Storing leaderboards and player profiles.
* **IoT:** Ingesting massive amounts of sensor data.

---

## Advantages

* **No Servers to Manage:** Zero operational overhead.
* **Auto-Scaling:** Grows and shrinks based on traffic.
* **Enterprise Grade:** Supports ACID transactions and 99.999% availability with Global Tables.
* **Performance at Scale:** Latency does not increase as the database grows.

---

## Limitations

* **No Joins:** You must model data to avoid needing joins.
* **Query Limitations:** You cannot perform complex SQL-like queries easily.
* **Item Size:** Maximum size per item is **400 KB**.

## Interview One-Line Answer

> *AWS DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database that provides consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It supports both document and key-value data models, offers built-in security, backup/restore, and multi-region replication via Global Tables.*
