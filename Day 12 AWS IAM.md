# 🔐 What is IAM? (Simple Explanation)

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is the security system of AWS.  
It decides **who can access what** in your AWS account.

Think of IAM like a security guard:

- **Users** = People who need access  
- **Roles** = Permissions for AWS services (EC2, Lambda, GitHub Actions, Terraform)  
- **Policies** = Rules that say what actions are allowed  
- **Groups** = Team permissions

# 🧑‍💻 How to Use IAM (Step-by-Step Guide)

---

## ✅ 1. Create IAM Users (for people)

Use users for human access, not automation.

### **Steps:**
- Go to **AWS Console → IAM → Users**
- Click **Create user**
- Give name (e.g., `devops-user`)
- Attach permissions (Admin or custom)
- Create login credentials
- **Enable MFA** (very important!)

**Purpose:** Logging into AWS as a person.

## ✅ 2. Create Groups (for teams)

Groups help give the same permissions to multiple users.

### **Examples:**
- DevOps-Team  
- Developers  
- Admin-Team  

### **Steps:**
- IAM → **User groups**
- Create group
- Attach common policies
- Add users to group

---

## ✅ 3. Create IAM Roles (for AWS services)

Roles are used by **machines**, not humans.

### **Examples:**
- EC2 instance role  
- Lambda execution role  
- GitHub Actions OIDC role  
- Jenkins role  
- Terraform role  

### **Steps:**
- IAM → **Roles** → Create role  
- Choose Service (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
- Attach policies (S3, EC2, CloudWatch)
- Attach role to service

### **Use Examples:**
- EC2 can read S3 objects using a role  
- GitHub Actions deploys to AWS using a role (no access keys)

---

## ✅ 4. Attach Policies (Permissions)

A policy is a JSON document that defines allowed actions.

### **Example Policy:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
