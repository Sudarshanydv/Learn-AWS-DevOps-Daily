## 📅 Day 17 | AWS EFS (Elastic File System) — Shared Storage in AWS 🗂️☁️

Today, I learned about **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**, which is a **fully managed, scalable, shared file system** in AWS.  
EFS allows multiple EC2 instances to **read and write data simultaneously**, making it ideal for **DevOps and cloud-native architectures**.

EFS helps in building **highly available, scalable, and persistent storage solutions** for applications running across multiple Availability Zones.

> **Amazon EFS is a fully managed shared file system that provides scalable and highly available storage for multiple EC2 instances across availability zones using NFS.**

# AWS EFS (Elastic File System) – Step by Step DevOps Guide

This guide explains **Amazon EFS** in a **simple, fresher-friendly DevOps way**, ready to upload on **GitHub (Markdown format)**.

## 1️⃣ What is AWS EFS?

**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)** is a **fully managed, scalable, shared file system** provided by AWS.

👉 Think of EFS like **Google Drive for EC2 instances** — multiple EC2 instances can **read and write the same data at the same time**.

---

## 2️⃣ Why We Use EFS in DevOps

EFS is used when we need:

* ✅ Shared storage between multiple EC2 instances
* ✅ Persistent data (data survives EC2 termination)
* ✅ High availability (multi-AZ)
* ✅ Linux-based file system (NFS)

---

## 3️⃣ Real-World DevOps Use Cases

| Use Case                      | Why EFS                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Web application uploads       | Same files for all EC2  |
| Jenkins shared workspace      | Multiple Jenkins agents |
| Kubernetes persistent storage | Shared PVC              |
| Centralized logs              | Common log directory    |
| WordPress media               | Shared media files      |

## 4️⃣ How EFS Works (Architecture)

```

 ↓
EC2 (AZ-1) ─┐
EC2 (AZ-2) ─┼──> EFS (Shared File System)
EC2 (AZ-3) ─┘
```

* EFS is **regional**
* Uses **NFS protocol (Port 2049)**
* Mounted like a folder inside EC2

## 5️⃣ EBS vs EFS vs S3 (Interview Comparison)

| Feature       | EBS           | EFS          | S3       |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Storage Type  | Block         | File         | Object   |
| Attach        | Single EC2    | Multiple EC2 | Internet |
| OS Support    | Linux/Windows | Linux only   | Any      |
| Mountable     | Yes           | Yes          | No       |
| Shared Access | ❌             | ✅            | ✅        |

---

## 6️⃣ Step-by-Step: How to Create and Use EFS

### 🔹 Step 1: Create EFS

1. AWS Console → **EFS**
2. Click **Create file system**
3. Select **VPC**
4. Availability Zones → Auto selected
5. Click **Create**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure Security Group

EFS needs **NFS access**.

**Inbound Rule:**

```
Type: NFS
Port: 2049
Source: EC2 Security Group
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance

* Amazon Linux 2
* Same VPC as EFS
* Attach same Security Group
* SSH into the instance

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Install EFS Utilities

```bash
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Create Mount Directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Mount EFS to EC2

```bash
sudo mount -t efs fs-xxxx:/ /efs
```

Check mount:

```bash
df -h
```

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Test Shared Storage

```bash
cd /efs
sudo touch devops.txt
```

Mount the same EFS on another EC2 → file will be visible ✅

---

## 7️⃣ Auto-Mount EFS on Reboot (Important)

Edit fstab file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add entry:

```bash
fs-xxxx:/ /efs efs defaults,_netdev 0 0
```

| Infrequent Access (IA) | Lower cost           |
| One Zone               | Cheapest (single AZ) |

---

## 🔟 EFS Usage in DevOps Tools

| Tool       | Usage                    |
