# 🌱 AWS Elastic Beanstalk – DevOps Explanation

## What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that helps you **deploy, manage, and scale applications automatically** without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

You just upload your **application code**, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles:

* EC2 instances
* Load Balancer
* Auto Scaling
* Monitoring
* Application updates

---

## Why DevOps Engineers Use Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is useful when:

* You want **fast deployment**
* You don’t want to manage infrastructure manually
* You need **auto scaling + high availability**
* You want **CI/CD friendly deployments**

---

## Elastic Beanstalk Architecture (Behind the Scenes)

When you deploy an app, Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates:

* **EC2** – runs your application
* **Auto Scaling Group** – handles scaling
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)** – distributes traffic
* **Security Groups** – network security
* **CloudWatch** – logs & monitoring
* **S3** – stores application versions

> You control everything, but AWS manages it for you.

## How Elastic Beanstalk Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Create an Application

* Logical container for your app

### 2. Choose Platform

Supported platforms include:

* Java
* Python
* Node.js
* .NET
* PHP
* Docker

### 3. Upload Code

* ZIP file
* WAR file
* Docker image

### 4. Environment Created

* **Web Server Environment** (most common)
* **Worker Environment** (background jobs)

### 5. Application Runs

```
User → Load Balancer → EC2 Instances → Application
```

## Deployment Options in Elastic Beanstalk

Important for interviews:

* **All at Once** – Fastest, but downtime possible
* **Rolling** – Updates instances in batches
* **Rolling with Additional Batch** – Safer than rolling
* **Immutable** – Zero downtime, safest
* **Blue/Green Deployment** – Best practice for production

---

## Configuration Options

You can customize:

* Instance type
* Auto Scaling rules
* Environment variables
* Load balancer settings
* Health checks

Configuration methods:

* AWS Console
* AWS CLI
* `.ebextensions` (YAML configuration files)

---

## CI/CD with Elastic Beanstalk

Typical DevOps pipeline:

```
Git → Jenkins / GitHub Actions → Build → Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk
```

Features:

* Application versioning
* Rollback support
* Automated deployments

---

## Monitoring & Logs

* CloudWatch metrics
* Application logs
* Environment health dashboard (Green / Yellow / Red)

---

## Security in Elastic Beanstalk

* IAM roles & policies
* Security Groups
* VPC support
* SSL/TLS using ACM
* Environment-level isolation

---

## Advantages

* Easy to use
* Automatic scaling
* Built-in load balancing
* Supports multiple languages
* Reduced operational overhead

---

## Limitations

* Less control than raw EC2
* Not ideal for complex microservices
* Slightly higher cost than manual EC2 setup

---

## Interview One-Line Answer

> *AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS service that allows developers and DevOps engineers to deploy and manage applications without managing infrastructure. It automatically handles EC2, load balancing, auto scaling, monitoring, and supports multiple deployment strategies.*
